            I work on building Cloud Native products such as APIs. My experience is on AWS services
            such as S3, EC2, and Lambda. However, I am always willing to learn and try new things and
            getting out of my comfort zone is nothing new to me.
            <br><br>
            I love dancing and am actively working out to improve my breaking and k-pop dancing skills
            and I also enjoy music, I used to play in a marching band and I have kept that love for music
            ever since.
            <br><br>
            Researchwise, I was fortunate to work at the Duke Department of Physics, the Duke Sanford School
            of Public Policy, and the Data Science Research Center at Duke Kunshan. I have collaborated in one paper and
            co-authored two other papers which have been presented at IEEE and ICML workshops.
